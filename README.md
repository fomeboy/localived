# localived (work in progress)

Publishing platform with reactive backend supported by the pub/sub functionality provided by Meteor. Backend will provide the methods necessary to store the dynamic published data in MongoDB and also store some static contextual collections available locally on MiniMongo on the client. The UI is being developed in React wrapped in a Meteor container.
